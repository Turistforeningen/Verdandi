From the Old Norse Verðandi meaning "becoming, happening". Verdandi was one of
the three Norns, or goddesses of destiny, in Norse mythology. She was
responsible for the present.

```
                                        Thence come maidens
                                            much knowing
                                        three from the hall
                                    which under that tree stands;
                                         Urd hight the one,
                                        the second Verdandi,
                                      on a tablet they graved,
                                          Skuld the third;
                                       Laws they established,
                                            life allotted
                                         to the sons of men,
                                        destinies pronounced.
